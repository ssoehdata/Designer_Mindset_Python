# Notes#
##################
# In python -type hints are not required(ignored at runtime), but are helpful for dev e.g. static analysis
# 
# Static vs. Dynamic types(when they are acquired):
# Static  - during compilation phase,allows for optimization
# Dynamic - at runtime 

# Manifest vs. Inferred(how types are being specified and detected):
# Manifest - types of variables, functions etc. explicitly defined
# Inferred - compiler or interpreter infers the type from code context

# Nominal vs. Structural(whether the type IDÂ´d by name or by its structure):
# Nominal - 
# Structural - 

# Duck Type(Python uses this paradigm): - 

# Strong vs. Weak Typing:
# Strong -
# Weak -
